The code was originally on an [R-forge repository](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/soueidatt/).


This package proposes a model-based clustering algorithm for multivariate functional data. The parametric mixture model, based on the assumption of normality of the principal components resulting from a multivariate functional PCA, is estimated by an EM-like algorithm. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm is its ability to take into account the dependence among curves.
